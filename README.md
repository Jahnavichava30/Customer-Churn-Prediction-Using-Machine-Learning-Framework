# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Framework

## 📘 Overview

This project implements a scalable machine learning framework for predicting customer churn using a distributed architecture powered by Apache Spark, AWS S3, and Python. It demonstrates how to build end-to-end ML pipelines capable of handling large datasets efficiently while maintaining flexibility and automation. The project applies a 3-step general-purpose ML framework that can be adapted to solve various prediction problems across industries. The end goal is a robust, reusable, and automated workflow for churn prediction — helping businesses reduce customer loss and improve retention strategies.
